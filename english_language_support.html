            <p class="pera-1">The International School of Hyderabad acknowledges and celebrates the diversity of the student community and works to ensure equal access to education for all. We promote an atmosphere of integration and respect among students by enabling those with limited English proficiency to work as close to grade level as possible in the areas of listening, speaking, communicating, vocabulary, grammar, reading and writing, as well as developing intercultural understanding as they settle into life in Hyderabad, India.</p>

            <h2 class="head-2">In the Elementary School (Grades 1-5), ESOL is delivered in two ways:</h2>
            <p class="pera-1"><b>Intensive</b> – students attend ESOL classes three (45 minutes) sessions per week in order to consolidate their listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. Student numbers in these classes are kept to a maximum of three, in order for them to reach their full potential. These are done on a pull out basis with the ESOL teacher.</p>
            <p class="pera-1"><b>ESOL in the mainstream </b>–  ESOL teacher support is provided in class where clusters of students with limited English proficiency benefit from language support.</p>
            <p class="pera-1">An entry level document is filled in after initial observations and a class based assessment, to ascertain the level of competency in English. A plan is then worked out for the student by the ESOL and grade teachers. This gives students a sense of confidence to tackle further learning. ESOL support is provided until the child can participate in grade work through differentiated instruction. During this phase, the ESOL teacher provides curriculum support within the classroom, collaborating with the subject teacher during the planning and implementation of the lesson. This service covers subject areas other than English, depending on the need of the student. Parents receive regular communication and material is provided for home use as well.</p>
