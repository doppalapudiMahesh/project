            <p>In the secondary school, students continue to explore academic and co-curricular passions, reflect on themselves as individuals and members of a community, and how to work with others. It is important that our students gain knowledge about the world and how they can positively affect it. ISH challenges students to be open-minded, take on multiple perspectives, tackle global challenges, and never forget to support their local community.</p>
            <p>You can trust that ISH will help your child to reach their potential. Our challenging curriculum provides a steady increase in choice, rigor, and independence as students move up in grades, ending in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. ISH prepares students for placement in universities around the world by providing experiences that will support personal and academic success. Our drive is to provide a balance of learning and life experiences that will serve students well beyond their years on our campus.</p>
            <p>Best Wishes,</p>
            <p>Ben Wilkins</p>
