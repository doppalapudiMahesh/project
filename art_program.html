            <p class="pera">The curriculum for the Visual Arts program at the elementary level is imparted from Early Childhood to Grade 5. Our aim is to enhance the students' creative and cognitive abilities with regard to art. Exposure to a range of media such as clay, acrylic, water color as well as outdoor study - for instance, of foliage - enables students to develop their innate sense of curiosity. The activities are designed to encourage students to ideate and to create and such opportunities are also given at various events such as the Elementary Production and Synergy.</p>
